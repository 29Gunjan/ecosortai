The model integration with Google Drive has been successfully completed! Here's what's been done:

## Model Links Added:

All your model links have been added to the application:

1. **VGG16 Model:**
   - File: `vgg16_waste_classification_tf.h5`
   - ID: `1jwpyS7kOD5GpMmszPuCoEkFkwnMOx-1-`

2. **ResNet50 Model:**
   - File: `waste_classification22_model.h5`
   - ID: `19KLNDSrPqYqBfNIwYwsZxouCW4zRK47y`

3. **InceptionV3 Model:**
   - File: `inceptionv3_waste_classification_tf.h5`
   - ID: `17WY01-emhtiC2WvDecKYw680GlBGe0Gq`

4. **Plastic Classifier Model:**
   - File: `plastic_classifier_model.h5`

   - ID: `14euZ5Ka8TaVM56YUwxiT8RLt94LTLSrd`

## What Was Updated:

1. Modified `app.py` with your actual Google Drive file IDs
2. Updated `check_models.py` to include all five models
3. Enhanced `models/README.md` with direct download links
4. Committed and pushed all changes to your GitHub repository

## Deployment Ready!

Your application is now configured to use these models and is ready for deployment. Here's what happens when you deploy:

1. When the application starts, it will check if models exist locally
2. If models are missing, it will download them from your Google Drive links
3. The models will be cached locally for future use

## Checking Your Setup:

You can verify your setup by running:
```
python check_models.py
```

This will check if all models are either available locally or accessible from Google Drive.

## Next Steps:

1. Deploy your application using the instructions in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. Make sure your Google Drive links remain active and accessible
3. When your application runs, it will automatically use these models

All changes have been committed and pushed to your GitHub repository!
